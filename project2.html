	<h4>
		Future goals
	</h4>
	<p>	After graduation, I have a lot of goals: both professionally and personally.</p>
	</p><b>Professionally,</b> I would love to integrate my Economics and Computer Applications<br>
	 majors in some way. This summer I read the Walter Isaacson book,<i> Steve Jobs</i>, and <br>it really sparked my interest to work in technology.
	 I have been looking into management <br>consulting with a focus on the technology sector. </p>
	 <p> <b>Personally</b>, I would like to run a marathon at some point. It would be a good way to challenge 
	 <br> myself and focus on a relatively long term goal and accomplish something not too many people 
	 <br> can say they did. Lastly, I would also like to visit all 7 continents before I turn 35. 
	 I love to travel and 
	 <br>that would be a cool <q>Bucket List</q> item to check off the list.
